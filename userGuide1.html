        First of all, when you open the question setting app, you can see a map with UCL as the centre. When clicking the map, you can see the detailed coordinates information and at the same time it will be filled in the blankets of the latitude and longitude, also you can type the coordinates information yourself. Although this game is based on the location UCL, you can also select other points as you like! <br/>
        Secondly, after you have set your coordinates point, you can begin to set your question and answer options. Remembering that you can just write down the number of 1/2/3/4 in the correct answer blanket. After you submit it, the question points you created will show on the map!
